# CoreYZ

**Help me come up with a name for it!**

The world's first CoreYZ 3D printer!

## CAD Files

The CAD files are available in this repository. Please note that the design is still evolving, and many iterations are expected as I test and refine the parts. I'll find a time in the future to test the parts.

Currently, most of the printed parts are designed in colors A6B4C9 and CFDBE5.

For image previews of the 3D printer, please see the "Pictures" folder.

## Design Rationale

### Why two motors on the X-axis?

- **Future IDEX Variant:** Planning for an Independent Dual Extruder (IDEX) version.
- **Symmetric Weight Distribution:** To balance the weight on the X beam.
- **Consistent Acceleration:** To ensure that the acceleration on the X and Y axes is similar.

### Why CoreYZ?

- **Motor Efficiency:** Keeps all motors active during printing, which can save costs and improve efficiency.
- **Improved Leveling:** The lying gantry design allows for better leveling.
- **Feasibility:** Though this is a new design, the firmware can be derived from the Voron Switchwire.
