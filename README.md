# CoreYZ

**Help me come up with a name for it!**

Hi!

I promised to test my design but sorry,

I came up with a better idea and want to use CoreYZ on bedslingers instead


So the first stage (building an enclosed flying gantry CoreYZ printer) is archived. 


#### Currently the bedslinger CoreYZ is half finished, but I'm making the CAD availible~

I'll need to make the belt tensioners, which is very troublesome for me, and then this design will be done
