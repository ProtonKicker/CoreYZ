# CoreYZ
World's first CoreYZ 3D printer! 
Help me come up with a name for it!

The CAD is available right now~
They are not finished. Lots and lots of iterations are expected!

Right now the color of printed parts is: A6B4C9.

For image previews of the 3D printer, see the "Pictures" folder.


Why 2 motors on the X?
1. I am planning for an IDEX variant.
2. Make the X beam symmetric in weight distribution
3. To be sure that the acceleration on X and Y is about the same

Why CoreYZ?
1. Keep all motors active during print (save some cost and make the printer run more efficiently~)
2. Better leveling with lying gantry!
