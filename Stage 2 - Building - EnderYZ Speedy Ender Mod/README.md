# EnderYZ

Hi!

For those who are expecting an build for the Stage 1 design,

I promised to test my design but sorry,

I came up with a better idea and want to use CoreYZ on bedslingers instead


So the first stage (building an enclosed flying gantry CoreYZ printer) is archived. 


#### Currently the bedslinger CoreYZ's CAD is finished (might need some minor adjustments)

I'm starting the build and you will see the actual printer in action very soon!
