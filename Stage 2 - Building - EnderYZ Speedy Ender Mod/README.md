# EnderYZ

Hi!

For those who are expecting an build for the Stage 1 design,

I promised to test my design but sorry,

I came up with a better idea and want to use CoreYZ on bedslingers instead


So the first stage (building an enclosed flying gantry CoreYZ printer) is archived. 


#### Currently the bedslinger CoreYZ is almost finished, but I'm making the CAD availible~

I'll need to make the belt tensioners, which is very troublesome for me, and then this design will be done


Some parts are already printed and I am starting the build!
